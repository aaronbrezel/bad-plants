1,Abrus precatorius,"Known commonly as jequirity, crab's eye, rosary pea, 'John Crow' bead, precatory bean, Indian licorice, akar saga, giddee giddee, jumbie bead, ruti, and weather plant. The attractive seeds (usually about the size of a ladybug, glossy red with one black dot) contain abrin, a ribosome-inactivating protein related to ricin, and very potent. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, liver failure, and death, usually after several days. Ingesting a single seed can kill an adult human. The seeds have been used as beads in jewelry, which is dangerous; inhaled dust is toxic and pinpricks can be fatal. The seeds are unfortunately attractive to children.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Lucky_Bean_Creeper_%28Abrus_precatorius%29_pods_of_seeds_%2811587246435%29.jpg/400px-Lucky_Bean_Creeper_%28Abrus_precatorius%29_pods_of_seeds_%2811587246435%29.jpg
2,Aconitum genus,"Several species, commonly called aconite, wolfsbane and monkshood. All parts are poisonous. The poison is an alkaloid called aconitine, which disables nerves, lowers blood pressure, and can stop the heart. Even casual skin contact should be avoided; symptoms include numbness, tingling, and cardiac irregularity. It has been used as poison for bullets (by German forces during World War II), as a bait and arrow poison (ancient Greece), and to poison water supplies (reports from ancient Asia).[citation needed] If ingested, it usually causes burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth, followed by vomiting and nervous excitement. It is usually a quick-acting poison, and has been used in the past for killing wolves (hence one of the common names).",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Aconitum_napellus_004.JPG/400px-Aconitum_napellus_004.JPG
3,Actaea pachypoda,"Also known as doll's eyes or white baneberry.

12,Aquilegia genus,"Several species commonly known as columbine. Seeds and roots contain cardiogenic toxins which cause both severe gastroenteritis and heart palpitations if consumed. The flowers of various species were consumed in moderation by Native Americans as a condiment with other fresh greens, and are reported to be very sweet, and safe if consumed in small quantities. Native Americans also used very small amounts of the root as an effective treatment for ulcers. However, medical use of this plant is difficult due to its high toxicity; columbine poisonings are easily fatal.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/AQUILEGIA_VULGARIS_-_GUIXERS_-_IB-0174.JPG/400px-AQUILEGIA_VULGARIS_-_GUIXERS_-_IB-0174.JPG
13,Areca catechu,"Commonly known as betel nut palm and pinyang. The nut contains an alkaloid related to nicotine which is addictive. It produces a mild high, some stimulation, and lots of red saliva, which cannot be swallowed as it causes nausea. Withdrawal causes headache and sweats. Use is correlated with mouth cancer, and to a lesser extent asthma and heart disease.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/BuahPinangMuda.jpg/240px-BuahPinangMuda.jpg
14,Argemone mexicana,"Common names include Mexican poppy, flowering thistle, cardo or cardosanto. A. mexicana seeds contain 22–36% of a pale yellow non-edible oil, called argemone oil or katkar oil, which contains the toxic alkaloids sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine. Katkar oil poisoning causes epidemic dropsy, with symptoms including extreme swelling, particularly of the legs.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Argemone_Mexicana.jpg/400px-Argemone_Mexicana.jpg
15,Arnica montana,"Also known as wolf's bane. It contains the toxin helenalin, which can be poisonous if large amounts of the plant are eaten or small amounts of concentrated Arnica are used. Consumption of A. montana can produce severe gastroenteritis, internal bleeding of the digestive tract, raised liver enzymes (which can indicate inflammation of the liver), nervousness, accelerated heart rate, muscular weakness, and death if enough is ingested.[36][37] Contact with the plant can also cause skin irritation. In the Ames test, an extract of A. montana was found to be mutagenic. The plant's toxicity has led to the USFDA officially declaring it to be an unsafe.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Arnica_montana_%28flower_head%29.jpg/400px-Arnica_montana_%28flower_head%29.jpg
16,Arum maculatum,"Commonly known as cuckoo-pint, lords and ladies, jack-in-the-pulpit, wake robin, wild arum, devils and angels, cows and bulls, Adam and Eve, bobbins and starch-root. All parts of the plant can produce allergic reactions. The bright red berries contain oxalates of saponins and can cause skin, mouth and throat irritation, resulting in swelling, burning pain, breathing difficulties and stomach upset. One of the most common causes of plant poisoning.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Arummaculatum_1.jpg/400px-Arummaculatum_1.jpg
17,Atropa belladonna,"Commonly known as deadly nightshade, belladonna, devil's cherry and dwale, an Anglo-Saxon term meaning ""stupifying drink""). One of the most toxic plants found in the Western hemisphere, all parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids – as do those of its equally deadly sister species A.baetica, A.pallidiflora and A.acuminata. The active agents are atropine, hyoscine (scopolamine), and hyoscyamine, which have anticholinergic properties. The symptoms of poisoning include dilated pupils, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, tachycardia, loss of balance, staggering, headache, rash, flushing, dry mouth and throat, slurred speech, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, and convulsions. The root of the plant is generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to another. Ingestion of a single leaf of the plant can be fatal to an adult. Casual contact with the leaves can cause skin pustules. The berries pose the greatest danger to children because they look attractive and have a somewhat sweet taste. The consumption of two to five berries by children and ten to twenty berries by adults can be lethal. In 2009, a case of A. belladonna being mistaken for blueberries, with six berries ingested by an adult woman, was documented to result in severe anticholinergic syndrome. The plant's deadly symptoms are caused by atropine's disruption of the parasympathetic nervous system's ability to regulate involuntary activities such as sweating, breathing, and heart rate. The antidote for atropine poisoning is physostigmine or pilocarpine. A. belladonna is also toxic to many domestic animals, causing narcosis and paralysis. However, cattle and rabbits eat the plant seemingly without any harmful effects. In humans its anticholinergic properties will cause the disruption of cognitive capacities like memory and learning.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Flickr_-_don_macauley_-_Deadly_Nightshade.jpg/400px-Flickr_-_don_macauley_-_Deadly_Nightshade.jpg
18,Brugmansia genus,"Commonly known as angel's trumpet. All parts of all plants in this genus contain the tropane alkaloids scopolamine and atropine; often fatal. These plants are closely related to and were once grouped with members of the genus Datura, which contain the same deadly alkaloids. Effects of ingestion may include losing connection with reality and hallucinations. An unfortunate case has been reported in the neuroscience literature, about a young man performing self-amputation with pruning shears after intentionally ingesting brugmansia tea, boiled from just two flowers.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/AngelTrumpet_Mounts_Asit.jpg/400px-AngelTrumpet_Mounts_Asit.jpg
19,Caladium genus,"Commonly known as angel wings, elephant ear and heart of Jesus. All parts of all plants in this genus are poisonous. Symptoms are generally irritation, pain, and swelling of tissues. If the mouth or tongue swell, breathing may be fatally blocked.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Starr_071024-9740_Caladium_bicolor.jpg/400px-Starr_071024-9740_Caladium_bicolor.jpg
20,Calla palustris,"Also known as marsh calla, wild calla and water-arum. The plant is very poisonous when fresh due to its high oxalic acid content, but the rhizome (like that of Caladium, Colocasia, and Arum) is edible after drying, grinding, leaching and boiling.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Sumpfcalla_Sothrieth_01.jpg/400px-Sumpfcalla_Sothrieth_01.jpg
21,Caltha palustris,"Commonly known as marsh-marigold and kingcup. It contains several active substances of which the most important from a toxicological point of view is protoanemonin. Larger quantities of the plant may cause convulsions, burning of the throat, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, dizziness and fainting. Contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the juices can cause blistering or inflammation, and gastric illness if ingested. Younger parts seem to contain less toxics and heating breaks these substances down. Small amounts of Caltha in hay do not cause problems when fed to husbandry, but larger quantities lead to gastric illness.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Caltha_palustris_Moshchun2.JPG/400px-Caltha_palustris_Moshchun2.JPG
22,Cascabela thevetia,Also known as yellow oleander. All parts of the plant are toxic to most vertebrates as they contain cardiac glycosides.

24,Cerbera odollam,"Commonly known as the suicide tree. The seeds contain cerberin, a potent toxin related to digoxin. The poison blocks the calcium ion channels in heart muscle, causing disruption of the heart beat. This is typically fatal and can result from ingesting a single seed. Cerberin is difficult to detect in autopsies and its taste can be masked with strong spices, such as a curry. It is often used in homicide and suicide in India; Kerala's suicide rate is about three times the Indian average. In 2004, a team led by Yvan Gaillard of the Laboratory of Analytical Toxicology in La Voulte-sur-Rhône, France, documented more than 500 cases of fatal Cerbera poisoning between 1989 and 1999 in Kerala. They said ""To the best of our knowledge, no plant in the world is responsible for as many deaths by suicide as the odollam tree.' A related species is Cerbera tanghin the seeds of which are known as tanghin poison nut and have been used as an 'ordeal poison'.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Cerbera_odollam_%28Flowers%29.JPG/400px-Cerbera_odollam_%28Flowers%29.JPG
25,Chelidonium majus,"Also known as greater celandine. The whole plant is toxic in moderate doses as it contains a range of isoquinoline alkaloids, but there are claimed to be therapeutic uses when used at the correct dosage. The main alkaloid present in the herb and root is coptisine, with berberine, chelidonine, sanguinarine and chelerythrine also present. Sanguinarine is particularly toxic with an LD50 of only 18 mg per kg body weight. The effect of the fresh herb is analgesic, cholagogic, antimicrobial and oncostatic, with action as a central nervous system sedative. In animal tests, Chelidonium majus is shown to be cytostatic. Early studies showed that the latex causes contact dermatitis and eye irritation. Stains on skin of the fingers are sometimes reported to cause eye irritation after rubbing the eyes or handling contact lenses. The characteristic latex also contains proteolytic enzymes and the phytocystatin chelidostatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Chelidonium_majus20100511_10.jpg/400px-Chelidonium_majus20100511_10.jpg
26,Cicuta genus,"Commonly known as water hemlock, cowbane, wild carrot, snakeweed, poison parsnip, false parsley, children's bane and death-of-man. The root, when freshly pulled out of the ground, is extremely poisonous and contains the toxin cicutoxin, a central nervous system stimulant that induces seizures. When dried, the poisonous effect is reduced. The most common species is C. maculata; one of the species found in the Western USA, C. douglasii, often found in pastures and swamps, has especially thick stems and very large and sturdy flowers which are sometimes harvested for flower displays. This is inadvisable as the sap is also toxic.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Cicuta_virosa_002.JPG/400px-Cicuta_virosa_002.JPG
27,Cleistanthus collinus,"Ingestion of its leaves or a dicoction of its leaves causes hypokalemia (kaliuresis and cardiac arrhythmias), metabolic acidosis, hypotension and hypoxia.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Cleistanthus_collinus_%28Garari%29_in_Narsapur_forest%2C_AP_W_IMG_0165.jpg/400px-Cleistanthus_collinus_%28Garari%29_in_Narsapur_forest%2C_AP_W_IMG_0165.jpg
28,Clivia miniata,"Commonly known as Natal lily, bush lily and Kaffir lily. It contains small amounts of lycorine, making it poisonous.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Clivia_miniata1.jpg/400px-Clivia_miniata1.jpg
29,Codiaeum variegatum,"Also known as garden croton or variegated croton. As with many of the Euphorbiaceae, the sap can cause skin eczema in some people. The bark, roots, latex, and leaves are poisonous.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Codiaeum_variegatum%2C_Phipps_Conservatory.jpg/400px-Codiaeum_variegatum%2C_Phipps_Conservatory.jpg
30,Colchicum autumnale,"Commonly known as autumn crocus and meadow saffron. The bulbs contain colchicine. Colchicine poisoning has been compared to arsenic poisoning; symptoms typically start 2 to 5 hours after a toxic dose has been ingested but may take up to 24 hours to appear, and include burning in the mouth and throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and kidney failure. Onset of multiple-system organ failure may occur within 24 to 72 hours. This includes hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the GI tract, which may result in death. Additionally, sufferers may experience kidney damage resulting in low urine output and bloody urine, low white blood cell counts (persisting for several days), anemia, muscular weakness, and respiratory failure. Recovery may begin within 6 to 8 days. There is no specific antidote for colchicine, although various treatments do exist. Despite dosing issues concerning its toxicity, colchicine is prescribed in the treatment of gout, familial Mediterranean fever, pericarditis and Behçet's disease. It is also being investigated for its use as an anti-cancer drug.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Colchicum_autumnale_ENBLA03.jpeg/400px-Colchicum_autumnale_ENBLA03.jpeg
31,Conium maculatum,"Commonly known as hemlock, poison hemlock, spotted parsley, spotted cowbane, bad-man's oatmeal, poison snakeweed and beaver poison. All parts of the plant contain the alkaloid coniine which causes stomach pains, vomiting, and progressive paralysis of the central nervous system; can be fatal. Not to be confused with hemlock trees (Tsuga spp.), which, while not edible, are not nearly as toxic as the herbaceous plant. An infusion of poison hemlock is said to have killed Socrates in 399 BC.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Hemlockseeds.jpg/400px-Hemlockseeds.jpg
32,Consolida subgenus,"Commonly known as larkspur. Young plants and seeds are poisonous, causing nausea, muscle twitches, and paralysis; often fatal.

Can be fatal in children.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Coriaria_myrtifolia_3c.JPG/400px-Coriaria_myrtifolia_3c.JPG
35,Cytisus scoparius,"Commonly known as broom or common broom. Contains toxic alkaloids that depress the heart and nervous system. The alkaloid sparteine is a class 1a antiarrhythmic agent, a sodium channel blocker. It is not FDA approved for human use as an antiarrhythmic agent, and it is not included in the Vaughn Williams classification of antiarrhythmic drugs.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/2016.05.07.-02-Viernheim--Besenginster.jpg/400px-2016.05.07.-02-Viernheim--Besenginster.jpg
36,Daphne genus,"The berries (either red or yellow) are poisonous, causing burns to mouth and digestive tract, followed by coma; often fatal.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Daphne_mezereum_003.JPG/400px-Daphne_mezereum_003.JPG
37,Datura genus,"Several species commonly known as jimson weed, thorn apple, stinkweed, Jamestown weed, angel's trumpets, moonflower, and sacred datura. Containing the tropane alkaloids scopolamine, hyoscyamine, and atropine, all parts of these plants are poisonous, especially the seeds and flowers. Ingestion causes abnormal thirst, hyperthermia, severe delirium and incoherence, visual distortions, bizarre and possibly violent behavior, memory loss, coma, and often death; it is a significant poison to grazing livestock in North America. Datura has been used as an entheogenic drug by the indigenous peoples of the Americas and others for centuries, though the extreme variability in a given plant's toxicity depending on its age and growing environment make such usage an exceptionally hazardous practice; the difference between a recreational dose and a lethal dose is minuscule,[66] and incorrect dosage often results in death. For this same reason, Datura has also been a popular poison for suicide and murder, particularly in parts of Europe and India. Reports of recreational usage are overwhelmingly negative; the majority of those who describe their use of Datura find their experiences extremely unpleasant and often physically dangerous.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Datura_stramonium_002.JPG/400px-Datura_stramonium_002.JPG
38,Daucus carota,"Commonly known as wild carrot. It can be dangerously toxic to humans. Daucus carota has been reported to contain acetone, asarone, choline, ethanol, formic acid, HCN, isobutyric acid, limonene, malic acid, maltose, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pyrrolidine, and quinic acid. When in contact with wet Daucus carota, skin irritation and vesication may occur.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Ab_plant_184.JPG/400px-Ab_plant_184.JPG
39,Deathcamas,"Various genera in the family Melanthieae have species whose common names include ""deathcamas"", including Amianthium, Anticlea, Stenanthium, Toxicoscordion and Zigadenus. All parts of these plants are toxic, due to the presence of alkaloids.

54,Gloriosa superba,"Common names include flame lily, climbing lily, gloriosa lily, and fire lily. The plant is poisonous, toxic enough to cause human and animal fatalities if ingested. Every part of the plant is poisonous, especially the tuberous rhizomes. As with other members of the Colchicaceae, this plant contains high levels of colchicine, a toxic alkaloid. It also contains the alkaloid gloriocine. Within a few hours of the ingestion of a toxic amount of plant material, a victim may experience nausea, vomiting, numbness, and tingling around the mouth, burning in the throat, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. As the toxic syndrome progresses, rhabdomyolysis, ileus, respiratory depression, hypotension, coagulopathy, haematuria, altered mental status, seizures, coma, and ascending polyneuropathy may occur.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Gloriosa_superba_1.jpg/400px-Gloriosa_superba_1.jpg

59,Heracleum mantegazzianum,"Also known as giant hogweed. The sap is phototoxic, causing phytophotodermatitis (severe skin inflammations) when affected skin is exposed to sunlight or to UV rays. Initially the skin becomes red and starts itching. Then blisters form as the reaction continues over 48 hours. They form black or purplish scars, which can last several years. Hospitalization may become necessary.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Heracleum_mantegazzianum_Sausal_-_leaf.jpg/400px-Heracleum_mantegazzianum_Sausal_-_leaf.jpg

61,Hippomane mancinella,"Commonly known as manchineel. All parts of this tree, including the fruit, contain toxic phorbol esters typical of the Euphorbiaceae plant family. Specifically the tree contains 12-deoxy-5-hydroxyphorbol-6gamma, 7alpha-oxide, hippomanins, mancinellin, sapogenin, phloracetophenone-2, 4-dimethylether is present in the leaves, while the fruits possess physostigmine. Contact with the milky white latex produces strong allergic dermatitis. Standing beneath the tree during rain will cause blistering of the skin from even slight contact with this liquid (even a small drop of rain with the milky substance in it will cause the skin to blister). Burning tree parts may cause blindness if the smoke reaches the eyes. The fruit can also be fatal if eaten. Many trees carry a warning sign, while others have been marked with a red ""X"" on the trunk to indicate danger. In the French Antilles the trees are often marked with a painted red band a few feet above the ground. The Caribs used the latex of this tree to poison their arrows and would tie captives to the trunk of the tree, ensuring a slow and painful death. A poultice of arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) was used by the Arawaks and Taíno as an antidote against such arrow poisons. The Caribs were also known to poison the water supply of their enemies with the leaves. Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León was struck by an arrow that had been poisoned with manchineel sap during battle with the Calusa in Florida, dying shortly thereafter.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Hippomane_mancinella%2C_the_Death_Apple_%2811239909065%29.jpg/400px-Hippomane_mancinella%2C_the_Death_Apple_%2811239909065%29.jpg

67,Jacobaea vulgaris,"Commonly known as ragwort. Contains many different alkaloids, including jacobine, jaconine, jacozine, otosenine, retrorsine, seneciphylline, senecionine, and senkirkine. Poisonous to livestock and hence of concern to people who keep horses and cattle. Horses do not normally eat fresh ragwort due to its bitter taste, however it loses this taste when dried, and becomes dangerous in hay. The result, if sufficient quantity is consumed, can be irreversible cirrhosis of the liver. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucus membranes, depression, and lack of coordination. The danger is that the toxin can have a cumulative effect; the alkaloid does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage DNA and progressively kills cells. Jacobaea vulgaris is also theoretically poisonous to humans, although poisoning is unlikely as it is distasteful and not used as a food. However, some sensitive individuals can suffer from an allergic skin reaction after handling the plant because, like many members of the family Compositae, it contains sesquiterpine lactones (which are different from the pyrrolizidine alkaloids responsible for the toxic effects), which can cause compositae dermatitis.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/20150621Jacobaea_vulgaris3.jpg/400px-20150621Jacobaea_vulgaris3.jpg

81,Mentha pulegium,"Known commonly as pennyroyal or pennyrile. It is toxic to humans and has differing effects dependent on the volume and concentration ingested. The most concentrated and toxic form of the pennyroyal plant is pennyroyal oil. The oil contains 80% to 92% of cyclohexanone pulegone. Pulegone is the molecule in highest concentration, causes a variety of ailments in those who ingest it and is what causes the plant to have its peppermint flavor. Symptoms that may persist after ingesting a small dose (<10 mL) of pennyroyal oil are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dizziness. Larger volumes may result in multiorgan failure that could lead to death.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Mentha_Pulegium_Ecoherbes_Park.jpg/400px-Mentha_Pulegium_Ecoherbes_Park.jpg

86,Oenanthe crocata,"Commonly known as hemlock water dropwort. Contains oenanthotoxin. The leaves may be eaten safely by livestock, but the stems and especially the carbohydrate-rich roots are much more poisonous. Animals familiar with eating the leaves may eat the roots when these are exposed during ditch clearance – one root is sufficient to kill a cow, and human fatalities are also known in these circumstances. Scientists at the University of Eastern Piedmont in Italy claimed to have identified this as the plant responsible for producing the sardonic grin, and it is the most-likely candidate for the ""sardonic herb,"" which was a neurotoxic plant used for the ritual killing of elderly people in Phoenician Sardinia. When these people were unable to support themselves, they were intoxicated with this herb and then dropped from a high rock or beaten to death. Criminals were also executed in this way.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Oenanthe_crocata_LeaValley.jpg/400px-Oenanthe_crocata_LeaValley.jpg
87,Paris quadrifolia,"Commonly known as herb-paris. Each plant only produces one blueberry-like berry, which is poisonous, as are other tissues of the plant. Paris quadrifolia poisonings are rare, because the plant's solitary berry and its repulsive taste make it difficult to mistake it for a blueberry.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Paris_quadrifolia_PID1636-1.jpg/400px-Paris_quadrifolia_PID1636-1.jpg

101,Quercus genus,"Several species, commonly known as oak. The leaves and acorns of oak species are poisonous in large amounts to humans and livestock, including cattle, horses, sheep and goats, but not pigs. Poisoning is caused by the toxin tannic acid, which causes gastroenteritis, heart trouble, contact dermatitis and kidney damage. Symptoms of poisoning include lack of appetite, depression, constipation, diarrhea (which may contain blood), blood in urine, and colic; it is rarely fatal, however, and in fact after proper processing acorns are consumed as a staple food in many parts of the world.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Quercus_chrysolepis_acorns.jpg/400px-Quercus_chrysolepis_acorns.jpg

103,Rhododendron genus,"Several species including those known as azalea. All parts are poisonous and cause nausea, vomiting, depression, breathing difficulties, and coma, though it is rarely fatal. The primary source of toxicity is a group of closely related compounds called grayanotoxins, which block sodium ion channels in cellular membranes and prevent electrical repolarization during action potentials. Honey made from the nectar of Rhododendron plants may contain dangerous concentrations of grayanotoxins, and has been historically used as a poison and in alcoholic drinks.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/0_Rhododendron_-_Celles_%28Hainaut%29_3.JPG/400px-0_Rhododendron_-_Celles_%28Hainaut%29_3.JPG
104,Rhododendron ferrugineum,"Commonly called alpenrose, snow-rose or rusty-leaved alpenrose.

106,Rhododendron tomentosum,"Commonly known as marsh Labrador tea or wild rosemary. All parts of the plant contain poisonous terpenes that affect the central nervous system. First symptoms of overdose are dizziness and disturbances in movement, followed by spasms, nausea, and unconsciousness. The mere smell of the plant may cause headache to some people.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Sumpfporst_%28Liebig%29.jpg/400px-Sumpfporst_%28Liebig%29.jpg
107,Rhus genus,"Certain species commonly known as African sumac. Formerly grouped with poison ivy and the rest of the Toxicodendron genus, all parts of this tree contain low levels of a highly irritating oil with urushiol. Skin reactions can include blisters and rashes. The oil spreads readily to clothes and back again, and has a very long life. Infections can follow scratching. As urushiol is not a poison but an allergen, it will not affect certain people. The smoke of burning Rhus lancia can cause reactions in the lungs, and can be fatal.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/SumacFruit.JPG/440px-SumacFruit.JPG
108,Ricinus communis,"Commonly known as castor oil plant, castor bean and Palma Christi. The seeds contain ricin, an extremely toxic and water-soluble ribosome-inactivating protein; it is also present in lower concentrations in other parts of the plant. Also present are ricinine, an alkaloid, and an irritant oil. According to the 2007 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records, the castor oil plant is the most poisonous in the world, though its cousin abrin, found in the seeds of the jequirity plant, is arguably more lethal. Castor oil, long used as a laxative, muscle rub, and in cosmetics, is made from the seeds, but the ricin protein is denatured during processing. Ricin irreversibly inhibits the ribosome, the molecular machine responsible for producing proteins in cells. The LD50 in adults is only about 22 ?g/kg when injected or inhaled; ingested ricin is much less toxic due to the digestive activity of peptidases, although a dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg, or about 4 to 8 seeds, can still cause death via this route. Reports of actual poisoning are relatively rare. If ingested, symptoms may be delayed by up to 36 hours but commonly begin within 2–4 hours. These include a burning sensation in the mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging and bloody diarrhea. Within several days there is severe dehydration, a drop in blood pressure and a decrease in urine. Unless treated, death can be expected to occur within 3–5 days; if victims have not succumbed after this time, they often recover. Toxicity varies among animal species: 4 seeds will kill a rabbit, 5 a sheep, 6 an ox or horse, 7 a pig, and 11 a dog. Poisoning occurs when animals ingest broken seeds or break the seed by chewing; intact seeds may pass through the digestive tract without releasing the toxin. Ducks have shown substantial resistance to the seeds: it takes an average of 80 to kill them. It was famously used to assassinate Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in 1978.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Castor_Oil_Plant_-_Flickr_-_treegrow.jpg/400px-Castor_Oil_Plant_-_Flickr_-_treegrow.jpg
109,Robinia genus,"Also known as black locust and false acacia. All species produce toxic lectins. The poison is a complex mix of lectins with the highest concentration in the fruit and seed, followed by the root bark and the flower. There is little poison in the leaf. The lectins, generally called robin are less toxic than those of e.g. Abrus (abrin) or Ricinus (ricin), and in non-fatal cases the toxic effects tend to be temporary.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Gew%C3%B6hnliche_Robinie.JPG/400px-Gew%C3%B6hnliche_Robinie.JPG
110,Sambucus genus,"Commonly known as elder or elderberry. The roots, twigs, leaves, and unripe fruit are considered poisonous and cause nausea and digestive upset. Ripe berries must be cooked before consumption.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/20140421Sambucus_racemosa2.jpg/400px-20140421Sambucus_racemosa2.jpg
111,Sanguinaria canadensis,"Commonly known as bloodroot. The rhizome contains morphine-like benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, primarily the toxin sanguinarine. Sanguinarine kills animal cells by blocking the action of Na+/K+-ATPase transmembrane proteins. As a result, applying S. canadensis to the skin may destroy tissue and lead to the formation of a large scab, called an eschar. Although applying escharotic agents, including S. canadensis, to the skin is sometimes suggested as a home treatment for skin cancer, these attempts can be severely disfiguring, as well as unsuccessful. Case reports have shown that in such instances tumor has recurred and/or metastasized. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the inclusion of sanguinarine in toothpastes as an antibacterial or anti-plaque agent, although it is believed that this use may cause leukoplakia, a premalignant oral lesion. The safe level of sanguinarine in such products is subject to regulation and debate. S. canadensis extracts have also been promoted by some supplement companies as a treatment or cure for cancer, but the FDA has listed some of these products among its ""187 Fake Cancer 'Cures' Consumers Should Avoid"". Bloodroot is a popular red natural dye used by Native American artists, especially among southeastern rivercane basketmakers. However, in spite of supposed curative properties and historical use by Native Americans as an emetic, due to its toxicity internal use is not advisable (sanguinarine has an LD50 of only 18 mg per kg body weight).",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Bloodroot_%28Sanguinaria_canadensis%29_-_Flickr_-_Jay_Sturner.jpg/400px-Bloodroot_%28Sanguinaria_canadensis%29_-_Flickr_-_Jay_Sturner.jpg
112,Scopolia carniolica,"Known as European scopolia or henbane bell. Its toxicity derives from its high levels of tropane alkaloids, particularly atropine. The quantity of atropine is the highest in the root.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Scopolia_carniolica_2016-04-19_7981b.JPG/400px-Scopolia_carniolica_2016-04-19_7981b.JPG
113,Solanum dulcamara,"Commonly known as bittersweet nightshade. All parts are poisonous, containing solanine and causing fatigue, paralysis, convulsions, and diarrhea. Rarely fatal.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/20140819Solanum_dulcamara2.jpg/400px-20140819Solanum_dulcamara2.jpg
114,Solanum nigrum,"Commonly known as black nightshade. All parts of the plant except the ripe fruit contain the toxic glycoalkaloid solanine. Solanine poisoning is primarily displayed by gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, burning of the throat, cardiac dysrhythmia, headache and dizziness. In more severe cases, hallucinations, loss of sensation, paralysis, fever, jaundice, dilated pupils and hypothermia can result. In large quantities, solanine poisoning can be fatal.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Black_Nightshade_-_Flickr_-_treegrow_%282%29.jpg/400px-Black_Nightshade_-_Flickr_-_treegrow_%282%29.jpg
115,Solanum pseudocapsicum,"Commonly known as Jerusalem cherry, Madeira winter cherry and winter cherry. All parts, especially the berries, are poisonous, causing nausea and vomiting. It is occasionally fatal, especially to children.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Solanum_pseudocapsicum2.jpg/400px-Solanum_pseudocapsicum2.jpg
116,Sophora secundiflora,Commonly known as mescal bean and Texas mountain laurel.,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Calia_secundiflora_pods.jpg/400px-Calia_secundiflora_pods.jpg
117,Strophanthus gratus,"The ripe seeds of this African plant contain ouabain, a potent cardiac glycoside that, when sufficiently concentrated, can induce cardiac arrest by binding to and inhibiting the action of the sodium-potassium pump and thereby drastically slowing the contraction of cardiac muscle cells. It was once used medicinally in small doses to treat congestive heart failure and other heart conditions, but has largely been replaced by the structurally related digoxin. Extracts from Strophanthus gratus and the bark of Acokanthera species have long been used by Somali tribesmen to poison hunting arrows; if the concentration is high enough, an arrow poisoned with ouabain can kill an adult hippopotamus.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Strophanthus_gratus1.JPG/400px-Strophanthus_gratus1.JPG
118,Strychnos nux-vomica,"Commonly known as the strychnine tree. The seeds usually contain about 1.5% strychnine, an extremely bitter and deadly alkaloid. This substance throws a human into intense muscle convulsions and usually kills within three hours. The bark of the tree may also contain brucine, another dangerous chemical.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Strychnos_nux-vomica_%286941721082%29.jpg/400px-Strychnos_nux-vomica_%286941721082%29.jpg
119,Taxus baccata,"Commonly known as English yew, common yew and graveyard tree. Nearly all parts contain toxic taxanes (except the red, fleshy, and slightly sweet aril surrounding the toxic seeds). The seeds themselves are particularly toxic if chewed. Several people have committed suicide by ingesting leaves and seeds, including Catuvolcus, king of a tribe in what is now Belgium.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Yew_Berries.jpg/400px-Yew_Berries.jpg
120,Toxicodendron genus,"Several species, including Toxicodendron radicans commonly known as poison ivy, Toxicodendron diversilobum commonly known as poison-oak, and Toxicodendron vernix commonly known as poison sumac. All parts of these plants contain a highly irritating oil with urushiol. Skin reactions can include blisters and rashes. The oil spreads readily to clothes and back again, and has a very long life. Infections can follow scratching. Despite the common names, urushiol is actually not a poison but an allergen, and because of this it will not affect certain people. The smoke of burning poison ivy can cause reactions in the lungs, and can be fatal. The allergic reaction caused by contact with poison ivy afflicts more than 70% of the human population, with as many as 350,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Toxicodendron_radicans%2C_leaves.jpg/400px-Toxicodendron_radicans%2C_leaves.jpg
121,Urtica ferox,Commonly known as ongaonga. Even the lightest touch can result in a painful sting that lasts several days.,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Ongaonga-Karori.jpg/400px-Ongaonga-Karori.jpg
122,Veratrum genus,"Commonly known as false hellebore and corn lily. Several species, containing highly toxic steroidal alkaloids (e.g. veratridine) that activate sodium ion channels and cause rapid cardiac failure and death if ingested. All parts of the plant are poisonous, with the root and rhizomes being the most toxic. Symptoms typically occur between 30 minutes and 4 hours after ingestion and include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness, headache, sweating, muscle weakness, bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, and seizures. Treatment for poisoning includes gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal followed by supportive care including fluid replacement, antiemetics for persistent nausea and vomiting, atropine for treatment of bradycardia, and vasopressors for the treatment of hypotension. Native Americans used the juice pressed from the roots to poison arrows before combat. The dried powdered root of this plant was also used as an insecticide. The plants' teratogenic properties and ability to induce severe birth defects were well known to Native Americans, although they also used minute amounts of the winter-harvested root (combined with Salvia dorii to potentiate its effects and reduce the toxicity of the herb) to treat cancerous tumors. The toxic steroidal alkaloids are produced only when the plants are in active growth, so herbalists and Native Americans who used this plant for medicinal purposes harvested the roots during the winter months when the levels of toxic constituents were at their lowest. The roots of V. nigrum and V. schindleri have been used in Chinese herbalism (where plants of this genus are known as ""li lu"" (??). Li lu is used internally as a powerful emetic of last resort, and topically to kill external parasites, treat tinea and scabies, and stop itching. However some herbalists refuse to prescribe li lu internally, citing the extreme difficulty in preparing a safe and effective dosage, and that death has occurred at a dosage of 0.6 grams. During the 1930s Veratrum extracts were investigated in the treatment of high blood pressure in humans. However patients often suffered side effects due to the narrow therapeutic index of these products. Due to its toxicity, the use of Veratrum as a treatment for high blood pressure in humans was discontinued.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Blad_van_Veratrum_nigrum.jpg/400px-Blad_van_Veratrum_nigrum.jpg
123,Vernicia fordii,"Known as the tung tree. It is poisonous in all of its parts, including the fruit and the seeds, although some parts of the tree have been used for medicinal purposes in the past. According to one university website, just one seed from the fruit can be fatal, and other symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, and slowed breathing. The leaves can also give a rash similar to that from poison ivy.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Vernicia_fordii8.jpg/400px-Vernicia_fordii8.jpg
124,Viscum genus,"Commonly known as European mistletoe; see also the related genus Phoradendron). Mistletoe is a common hemiparasite of trees and shrubs. Toxicity varies by species, but all parts of the plant, especially the leaves and berries, contain an array of toxic chemicals, including several different viscotoxins, the alkaloid tyramine, and a ribosome-inactivating lectin called viscumin. Symptoms may include acute gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, weak pulse and/or slow heart rate, and even seizures; it is rarely lethal to adult humans, however, and many wild animals are adapted to eating its fruit.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Mistletoe_with_berries.jpg/400px-Mistletoe_with_berries.jpg
125,Voacanga africana,"The bark and seeds of this tropical tree contain a complex mixture of iboga alkaloids, including voacangine and voacamine. These compounds have been variously used as stimulants, psychedelic drugs, and poisons.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Voacanga_africana.jpg/440px-Voacanga_africana.jpg
126,Wisteria sinensis,"Also known as Chinese wisteria. All parts of the plant contain a glycoside called wisterin which is toxic if ingested and may cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhea. Wisterias have caused poisoning in children of many countries, producing mild to severe gastroenteritis.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Glycine_grappe_FR_2012.jpg/400px-Glycine_grappe_FR_2012.jpg
127,Xanthium genus,"Several species commonly known as cocklebur. The common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium), a native of North America, can be poisonous to livestock, including horses, cattle, and sheep. Some domestic animals will avoid consuming the plant if other forage is present, but less discriminating animals, such as pigs, will consume the plants and then sicken and die. The seedlings and seeds are the most toxic parts of the plants. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours, producing unsteadiness and weakness, depression, nausea and vomiting, twisting of the neck muscles, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty breathing, and eventually death. Xanthium has also been used for its medicinal properties and for making yellow dye, as indicated by its name (Greek xanthos = 'yellow').",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Ghaagara_%28Marathi-_%E0%A4%98%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%29_%282958242609%29.jpg/400px-Ghaagara_%28Marathi-_%E0%A4%98%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%29_%282958242609%29.jpg
128,Zantedeschia aethiopica,"Known as calla lily or arum lily. All parts of the plant are toxic, containing calcium oxalate, which induces irritation and swelling of the mouth and throat, acute vomiting and diarrhea. Can be fatal.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Funchal_-_Zantedeschia_aethiopica_IMG_1904.JPG/400px-Funchal_-_Zantedeschia_aethiopica_IMG_1904.JPG
